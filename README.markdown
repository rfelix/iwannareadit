# I Wanna Read It!

This is my individual project for the [RMU](http://university.rubymendicant.com/) January Session I'm participating in.

## Description

I Wanna Read It! is a web application that enables users of an
organization to suggest new books to buy. Each submission can then be
voted up/down by other memebers, allowing those with the â‚¬/$ to purchase
the books people actually want to read.

Once the book has been bought, this app also manages the lending of
books so that everyone knows at any given time who has which book. The
members can also add themselves to a queue and will be notified when
it's their turn to read the book.
